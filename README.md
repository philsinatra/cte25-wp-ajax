cte25-wp-ajax
=============

Pull post data via ajax in WordPress.

This technique requires jQuery to be running on the WordPress theme. There will be one addition to the `index.php` file, and one new file (`loop_handler.php`) that will handle the Ajax based database interaction. 

The custom javascript/ajax call in this example is inline within the `index.php` file.
